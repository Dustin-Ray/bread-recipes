# Miso Oatmeal with Charred Kale & Soft Boiled Eggs

*Serves 4*

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup steel-cut oats
- 4 cups water
- 2 tablespoons white miso
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1 head lacinato kale
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 4 eggs
- Flaky salt for garnish (optional)
- Chili crisp for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Oatmeal:** In a medium pot, combine 1 cup of steel-cut oats, 4 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of white miso, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Stir until the miso and salt are dissolved. Place the pot over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the oats are tender and thickened.

2. **Char the Kale:** While the oatmeal is cooking, strip the leaves from 1 head of lacinato kale and roughly chop them. In a bowl, toss the chopped kale with 1 tablespoon of neutral oil, ¼ teaspoon of black pepper, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Preheat a 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the kale. Cook without stirring for 2-3 minutes until it begins to char in spots. Stir and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fully wilted. Turn off the heat, add 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, and stir to combine. Set aside.

3. **Boil the Eggs:** Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Gently add 4 eggs and boil for 6½ minutes. Transfer them to an ice bath to cool and set aside.

4. **Assemble and Serve:** Once the eggs are cool, gently tap them on a cutting board to crack the shells. Peel the eggs under running water to make the process easier. Slice each egg in half and, if desired, sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Divide the oatmeal into 4 bowls, top each with two egg halves, and add a generous portion of the charred kale. Optionally, drizzle with chili crisp. Serve immediately.
