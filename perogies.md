# Sheet-Pan Pierogies and Beets

**Ingredients:**

- 1½ pounds frozen potato and cheese pierogies (such as Mrs. T’s)
- 4 tablespoons plus ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- Two 8.8-ounce packages cooked beets, drained and sliced ½ inch thick
- 1½ teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1 teaspoon Morton kosher salt, plus more
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey
- Sour cream and dill sprigs, for serving

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Oven:** Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare Pierogies:** In a medium bowl, toss 1½ pounds of frozen potato and cheese pierogies with 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil until well coated. Arrange them in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Reserve the bowl for later use.

3. **Prepare Beets:** In the reserved bowl, toss the two 8.8-ounce packages of drained and sliced cooked beets with 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and 1½ teaspoons of Diamond Crystal or 1 teaspoon of Morton kosher salt. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste. Arrange the beets on the same baking sheet with the pierogies.

4. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake until the pierogies are puffed and golden in spots, about 25 to 30 minutes.

5. **Prepare Dressing:** While the pierogies and beets are baking, in a small bowl, whisk together 1 finely chopped shallot, ¼ cup red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons poppy seeds, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon honey, and the remaining ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil. Season the dressing with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

6. **Serve:** Spread sour cream over serving plates. Top with the roasted pierogies and beets. Drizzle the poppy seed dressing over the top and garnish with dill sprigs. Season with additional freshly ground black pepper, if desired.
