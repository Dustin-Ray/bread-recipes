# Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles)

**Ingredients:**

- 8 ounces (225g) fresh wide rice noodles
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 Thai bird's eye chiles, finely chopped
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1/2 cup baby corn
- 1/2 cup snow peas
- 1/2 cup Thai basil leaves
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon (5g) sugar

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Noodles:** If using fresh wide rice noodles (8 ounces or 225g), separate them gently to prevent sticking. If using dried noodles, soak them in warm water according to the package instructions until softened, then drain and set aside.

2. **Make the Sauce:** In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce, 1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon (5ml) dark soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon (5g) sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves and set aside.

3. **Stir-Fry Aromatics:** Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 minced garlic cloves and 4 finely chopped Thai bird's eye chiles. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn them.

4. **Add Vegetables:** Add 1 sliced small onion, 1 sliced bell pepper, 1 cup broccoli florets, 1/2 cup baby corn, and 1/2 cup snow peas to the wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

5. **Add Noodles:** Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok and add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil to the center. Add the prepared noodles and pour the sauce over them. Toss everything together to ensure the noodles and vegetables are evenly coated with the sauce. Stir-fry for another 2 minutes.

6. **Add Basil:** Add 1/2 cup Thai basil leaves to the wok. Stir-fry for an additional minute until the basil is wilted and everything is well combined.

7. **Serve:** Transfer the Pad Kee Mao to serving plates and enjoy immediately.
