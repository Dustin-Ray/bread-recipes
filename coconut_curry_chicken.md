## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine **1 finely grated 3" piece of fresh ginger** and **5 finely grated garlic cloves**.
   - Add **¾ cup coconut milk**, **¼ cup hot chili paste**, **¼ cup fresh lime juice**, **2 Tbsp. light brown sugar**, **1 Tbsp. kosher salt**, and **2 Tbsp. vegetable oil**.
   - Whisk until the mixture is well combined.

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - Add **2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs** to the marinade, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.
   - Let the chicken marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 4 hours for more intense flavor.

3. **Prepare the Grill:**
   - Set up a grill for medium heat.
   - Clean and generously oil the grill grate to prevent sticking.

4. **Cook the Marinade:**
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl.
   - Transfer the chicken to a rimmed baking sheet.
   - Pour the remaining marinade into a small saucepan.
   - Bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and can coat the back of a spoon, about 2–3 minutes.

5. **Grill the Chicken:**
   - Place the marinated chicken thighs on the preheated grill.
   - Grill, turning once and basting occasionally with the reduced marinade, until grill marks appear and the chicken is cooked through, approximately 8–10 minutes total.

6. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the grilled chicken to a serving platter.
   - Brush with any remaining marinade.
   - Garnish with **½ cup cilantro leaves with tender stems**.
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the chicken.
