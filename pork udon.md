# Pork and Tomatillo Udon

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pound fresh udon noodles (or 8 ounces dried udon noodles)
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt)
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 1/4 cups store-bought tomatillo salsa (such as Sabor Mexicano)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus leaves with tender stems for serving
- Thinly sliced radishes, for serving

**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the Udon Noodles:**
   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
   - Add 1 pound of fresh udon noodles (or 8 ounces of dried udon noodles) and cook according to the package directions until tender.
   - Drain the noodles and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Pork and Sauce:**
   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
   - Add 1 pound of ground pork and 1/2 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1/4 teaspoon of Morton kosher salt).
   - Cook, breaking up the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until the pork is mostly cooked through, about 3 minutes.
   - Stir in 3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce and continue to cook until the meat is coated and caramelized, approximately 2 minutes.
   - Pour in 1 1/4 cups of store-bought tomatillo salsa and cook, stirring, until combined and heated through, about 1 minute.

3. **Combine Noodles and Sauce:**
   - Add 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to the skillet and allow it to melt.
   - Add the cooked udon noodles to the skillet and toss to combine, ensuring the noodles are well-coated with the sauce, about 1 minute.
   - Remove from heat and mix in 2/3 cup of chopped cilantro.

4. **Serve:**
   - Divide the udon among shallow bowls.
   - Top each serving with thinly sliced radishes and additional cilantro leaves with tender stems.
   - Serve immediately.
