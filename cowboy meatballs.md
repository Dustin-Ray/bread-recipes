# Cowboy Meatballs (Serves 2)

**Ingredients:**

- ½ pound ground beef
- ¼ cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large egg
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
- ½ cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Meatball Mixture:** In a medium bowl, combine ½ pound of ground beef, ¼ cup of panko breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, ½ teaspoon of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon of kosher salt, and ¼ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. Mix until just combined; avoid overmixing to keep the meatballs tender.

2. **Form Meatballs:** Using your hands, form the mixture into meatballs about 1½ inches in diameter, yielding approximately 8 meatballs.

3. **Sear the Meatballs:** In a large ovenproof skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside.

4. **Prepare the Sauce:** In the same skillet, add 1 (14.5-ounce) can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with their juices) and 1 (4-ounce) can of diced green chiles. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

5. **Combine and Simmer:** Return the meatballs to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes.

6. **Add Cheese:** Sprinkle ½ cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the meatballs. Cover the skillet again and cook until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.

7. **Serve:** Garnish with 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve the meatballs and sauce over rice, mashed potatoes, or with crusty bread.

# Mexican Cornbread

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
- 1 medium jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped
- 4 medium scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Oven:** Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish or a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with butter or nonstick cooking spray.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup of cornmeal, 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt until well combined.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup of buttermilk, 2 large eggs, and the melted and slightly cooled 8 tablespoons (1 stick) of unsalted butter until thoroughly mixed.

4. **Incorporate Wet into Dry:** Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined; avoid overmixing to ensure a tender cornbread.

5. **Fold in Additions:** Gently fold in 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 cup of corn kernels, 1 finely chopped medium jalapeño pepper, 4 thinly sliced medium scallions, and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro (if using) until evenly distributed.

6. **Transfer to Baking Dish:** Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish or skillet, spreading it into an even layer.

7. **Bake:** Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake until the cornbread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes.

8. **Cool and Serve:** Remove from the oven and let the cornbread cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
