# Cowboy Meatballs (Serves 2)

**Ingredients:**

- ½ pound ground beef
- ¼ cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large egg
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
- ½ cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Meatball Mixture:** In a medium bowl, combine ½ pound of ground beef, ¼ cup of panko breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, ½ teaspoon of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon of kosher salt, and ¼ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. Mix until just combined; avoid overmixing to keep the meatballs tender.

2. **Form Meatballs:** Using your hands, form the mixture into meatballs about 1½ inches in diameter, yielding approximately 8 meatballs.

3. **Sear the Meatballs:** In a large ovenproof skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside.

4. **Prepare the Sauce:** In the same skillet, add 1 (14.5-ounce) can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with their juices) and 1 (4-ounce) can of diced green chiles. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

5. **Combine and Simmer:** Return the meatballs to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes.

6. **Add Cheese:** Sprinkle ½ cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the meatballs. Cover the skillet again and cook until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.

7. **Serve:** Garnish with 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve the meatballs and sauce over rice, mashed potatoes, or with crusty bread.

Enjoy your meal!
