# Hearty Chocolate Muesli Whole Wheat Bread with Oat Crust

This wholesome bread combines the rich flavors of cacao and molasses with the hearty texture of whole wheat flour and muesli. Topped with oats baked into the crust, it's perfect for breakfast or as a satisfying snack.

## Instructions:

1. **Activate the Yeast:**
   - In a small bowl, combine **1¼ cups warm oat milk** (about 110°F or 43°C) and **¼ cup molasses**. Stir until the molasses dissolves.
   - Sprinkle **2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast** (1 packet) over the mixture. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. **Prepare the Dry Mix:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together **3 cups whole wheat flour**, **2 tablespoons cacao powder**, **1½ teaspoons salt**, and **1 cup muesli**.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a medium bowl, mix **2 lightly beaten duck eggs** and **¼ cup melted and slightly cooled unsalted butter**.
   - Add the frothy yeast mixture to the egg and butter mixture. Stir well.

4. **Mix the Dough:**
   - Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the well.
   - Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.

5. **Knead the Dough:**
   - Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface.
   - Knead for about 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a bit more oat milk.

6. **First Rise:**
   - Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning it to coat all sides.
   - Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.
   - Let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size.

7. **Shape the Loaf:**
   - Punch down the dough to release air.
   - Shape it into a loaf or round boule, as desired.
   - Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or into a greased loaf pan.

8. **Second Rise:**
   - Cover the dough loosely with a towel or plastic wrap.
   - Let it rise for another 30–45 minutes until it has risen noticeably.

9. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to **375°F (190°C)**.

10. **Add the Oat Topping:**
    - Lightly brush the top of the dough with water or a little oat milk.
    - Sprinkle **½ cup oats** evenly over the top, gently pressing them into the dough.

11. **Bake:**
    - Bake for **35–40 minutes**, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom and has a golden crust.
    - If the top browns too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking.

12. **Cool:**
    - Remove the bread from the oven.
    - Let it cool in the pan or on the baking sheet for **10 minutes**.
    - Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
