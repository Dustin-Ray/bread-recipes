# Fondant Sweet Potatoes

**Ingredients:**

- 2 pounds medium sweet potatoes (about 3)
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Peel 2 pounds of medium sweet potatoes (about 3) and cut them into 2-inch-thick rounds.

2. **Sear the Sweet Potatoes:** In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, melt 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) of unsalted butter. Add the sweet potato rounds in a single layer and sear until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.

3. **Season the Sweet Potatoes:** Drizzle 2 tablespoons of honey over the seared sweet potatoes. Season with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.

4. **Add Broth and Herbs:** Carefully pour 1 cup of low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth into the skillet. Add 4 sprigs of fresh thyme.

5. **Roast the Sweet Potatoes:** Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast until the sweet potatoes are tender and the liquid has reduced to a glaze, about 20 to 25 minutes.

6. **Finish with Butter:** Remove the skillet from the oven and add the remaining 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) of unsalted butter, swirling the pan to coat the sweet potatoes with the melted butter and glaze.

7. **Serve:** Transfer the fondant sweet potatoes to a serving platter, spooning any remaining glaze from the skillet over the top. Serve immediately.
