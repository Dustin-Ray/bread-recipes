# Garlic Naan

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup warm water (about 110째F or 43째C)
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 cup plain yogurt
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of warm water (about 110째F or 43째C) with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then sprinkle 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast over the top. Let it sit until the mixture becomes frothy, about 10 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Dough:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. Add the yeast mixture, 1/4 cup of plain yogurt, and 1/4 cup of whole milk. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.

3. **Knead the Dough:** Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour as needed.

4. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.

5. **Divide the Dough:** Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, cover them with a damp cloth, and let them rest for 10 minutes.

6. **Prepare Garlic Butter:** In a small saucepan over low heat, melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Add 2 minced garlic cloves and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.

7. **Shape the Naan:** On a lightly floured surface, roll each dough ball into an oval or teardrop shape, about 1/4-inch thick.

8. **Cook the Naan:** Heat a large cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Place a rolled-out dough piece into the dry skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the bottom is golden brown and charred in spots, about 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for another 1 to 2 minutes.

9. **Apply Garlic Butter:** Remove the cooked naan from the skillet and immediately brush it with the prepared garlic butter. Sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro if desired. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.

10. **Serve:** Serve the garlic naan warm alongside your favorite dishes.
