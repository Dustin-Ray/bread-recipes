# Eggs Benedict Rolls

**Ingredients:**

- Cooking spray
- 1 teaspoon cornmeal
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 6 ounces Canadian bacon (about 10 slices)
- 5 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons whole milk
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 (13.8-ounce) package Pillsbury pizza crust
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- A pinch of cayenne pepper

**For the Hollandaise Sauce:**

- 2 large egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- Sliced fresh chives, for serving

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Baking Dish:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Spray an 8- or 10-inch ceramic baking dish with cooking spray and sprinkle the bottom with 1 teaspoon of cornmeal.

2. **Cook the Canadian Bacon:** In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter. Add 6 ounces of Canadian bacon slices and cook, turning occasionally, until the edges start to brown, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into ½-inch pieces.

3. **Prepare the Scrambled Eggs:** In a medium bowl, whisk together 5 large eggs and 3 tablespoons of whole milk. In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Pour in the egg mixture and gently stir with a rubber spatula until the eggs begin to set, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat while still slightly undercooked, as they will continue to cook from residual heat. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

4. **Assemble the Rolls:** On a work surface, unroll the 13.8-ounce package of Pillsbury pizza crust into a 15x10-inch rectangle. Spread 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard evenly over the dough and sprinkle with a pinch of cayenne pepper. Distribute the chopped Canadian bacon and scrambled eggs evenly over the mustard layer. Starting from the long side closest to you, roll the dough tightly into a log. Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 12 pieces, each about 1½ inches wide. Arrange the slices in the prepared baking dish, cut sides up.

5. **Bake:** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the dough is golden brown, about 25 minutes.

6. **Prepare the Hollandaise Sauce:** While the rolls are baking, in a standard blender or a tall cup suitable for an immersion blender, combine 2 large egg yolks, 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice, ¾ teaspoon of kosher salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon of water. Blend until frothy. In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt ½ cup (1 stick) of unsalted butter until fully melted. With the blender running on medium speed, slowly drizzle in the melted butter in a thin stream. Continue blending until the sauce is emulsified, thick, and bright yellow.

7. **Serve:** Once the rolls are done baking, remove them from the oven. Drizzle the hollandaise sauce over the warm rolls and garnish with sliced fresh chives. Serve immediately.
