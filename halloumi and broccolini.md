# Sheet-Pan Roasted Halloumi & Broccolini (Serves 2)

**Ingredients:**

- ½ lb. broccolini
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4.5 oz. halloumi cheese, cut into ½-inch slices
- ½ teaspoon sweet paprika
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ small bunch fresh chives
- ½ small bunch fresh parsley
- ½ clove garlic, peeled and smashed
- Zest of ½ lemon, plus juice of ¼ lemon
- ⅓ cup walnuts, raw or toasted

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Oven:** Place a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).

2. **Prepare Broccolini:** On a baking sheet, toss ½ lb. of broccolini with 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Spread the broccolini in an even layer.

3. **Initial Roasting:** Roast the broccolini in the preheated oven until it begins to soften, about 10 minutes.

4. **Season Halloumi:** In a medium bowl, gently toss 4.5 oz. of halloumi slices with ½ teaspoon of sweet paprika, ¼ teaspoon of dried oregano, ¼ teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil until the cheese is well coated.

5. **Combine and Roast:** Move the broccolini to the edges of the baking sheet and arrange the seasoned halloumi slices about ¼ inch apart in the center of the sheet. Continue to roast until the broccolini is charred and the halloumi is browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes more.

6. **Prepare Gremolata:** Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse ½ small bunch of fresh chives, ½ small bunch of fresh parsley, ½ peeled and smashed garlic clove, the zest of ½ lemon, and the juice of ¼ lemon until mostly smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the motor running, slowly pour in the remaining ¼ cup (4 tablespoons) of extra-virgin olive oil, continuing to scrape down the sides, until the mixture is emulsified. Add ⅓ cup of walnuts and pulse until only small chunks remain. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

7. **Serve:** Transfer the roasted broccolini and halloumi to a platter. Dollop the gremolata on top before serving.

Enjoy your meal!
