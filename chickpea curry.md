# Easy Chickpea Curry

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons grated garlic (approximately 3 to 4 garlic cloves)
- 2 teaspoons grated ginger (from an approximately 1-inch peeled piece of ginger)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
- 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- 2 packed cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces)

**Instructions:**

1. **Saut√© Aromatics:** In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup of vegetable oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add 2 teaspoons of grated garlic and 2 teaspoons of grated ginger; be cautious, as the mixture may sputter. Stir constantly and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, lowering the heat slightly if needed.

2. **Add Spices:** Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of ground cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon of ground turmeric, cooking for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.

3. **Incorporate Tomato Sauce:** Slowly pour in the 15-ounce can of tomato sauce, covering the pot briefly to minimize splatters. Stir to combine.

4. **Add Chickpeas and Coconut Milk:** Add the two 15-ounce cans of drained and rinsed chickpeas to the pot, then stir in the 15-ounce can of full-fat coconut milk.

5. **Season and Simmer:** Season with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, or to taste. Lower the heat to bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid and cook until the flavors meld and the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 to 12 minutes.

6. **Incorporate Spinach:** Taste the curry and adjust salt as needed. Add 2 packed cups of baby spinach (about 5 ounces), turn off the heat, and cover the pot. Allow the spinach to wilt in the residual heat for a few minutes before stirring to combine.

7. **Serve:** Serve the chickpea curry warm, accompanied by naan, rice, or bread of your choice.

Enjoy your meal!
