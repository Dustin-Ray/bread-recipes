# Chicken Couscous T'faya

**Ingredients:**

*For the Chicken:*

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion (8 ounces), diced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
- A light pinch of saffron threads (optional)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 1/2 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- 1 3/4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 small bunch cilantro, stems and leaves separated; stems tied into a bundle with kitchen twine

*For the T'faya Sauce:*

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 pounds white or yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 1 cup raisins, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, then drained
- 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

*For Serving:*

- Cooked couscous
- 3/4 cup toasted sliced almonds
- Reserved cilantro leaves

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - In a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter over medium heat until the butter is melted and shimmering.
   - Add 1 diced medium onion, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger, a light pinch of saffron threads (if using), 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and the mixture is fragrant, about 3 to 5 minutes.
   - Add 2 1/2 pounds of skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs to the pot, mixing to combine with the onions and spices.
   - Pour in 1 3/4 cups of chicken or vegetable stock and add the bundled cilantro stems.
   - Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Then, cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 175 to 185°F (79 to 85°C), about 40 to 45 minutes.
   - Discard the cilantro bundle and season the chicken to taste with additional salt and pepper if needed.

2. **Prepare the T'faya Sauce:**
   - While the chicken is simmering, in a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium-low heat until the butter is melted and shimmering.
   - Add 2 pounds of thinly sliced onions to the skillet. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 15 to 25 minutes.
   - Add the drained 1 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable stock, 3 tablespoons of honey, 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.
   - Simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the onions are golden brown and jammy, about 15 to 20 minutes.
   - Season the t'faya sauce to taste with additional salt and pepper if needed.

3. **Serve:**
   - Place the warm cooked couscous on a large serving platter or individual plates.
   - Top the couscous with the braised chicken pieces and spoon some of the braising broth over them.
   - Generously spoon the t'faya sauce over the chicken.
   - Garnish with 3/4 cup of toasted sliced almonds and the reserved cilantro leaves.
   - Serve any remaining broth separately in small bowls, allowing individuals to sip it between bites or pour it over their portion of couscous as desired.

Enjoy your meal!
