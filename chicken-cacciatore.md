# Chicken Cacciatore With Mushrooms, Tomato, and Onion

*Serves 4 to 6*

**Ingredients:**

- 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8kg) bone-in, skin-on chicken legs (thighs and drumsticks split)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- All-purpose flour, for dredging
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound (450g) cremini mushrooms, washed, trimmed, and quartered
- 1 medium (8-ounce; 225g) yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 5 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 3/4 cup (175ml) dry white wine
- 1 (28-ounce; 795g) can peeled whole tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand, plus 1/2 cup (120ml) reserved juices from can
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, sage, or thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- Minced flat-leaf parsley, for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Season and Dredge Chicken:** Season 3 to 4 pounds of bone-in, skin-on chicken legs all over with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour a roughly 1/2-inch layer of all-purpose flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge each chicken piece in the flour and tap off excess.

3. **Brown Chicken:** In a Dutch oven or large straight-sided sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add the floured chicken pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the browned chicken to a platter and set aside.

4. **Sauté Vegetables:** Add 1 pound of quartered cremini mushrooms to the pan and cook, scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Add 1 medium thinly sliced yellow onion and 5 thinly sliced garlic cloves; cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until softened, about 6 minutes.

5. **Deglaze and Add Liquids:** Pour in 3/4 cup of dry white wine and bring to a simmer. Add the hand-crushed tomatoes from a 28-ounce can, along with 1/2 cup of the reserved tomato juices, 2 sprigs of fresh herbs (rosemary, sage, or thyme), and 1 bay leaf. Return the mixture to a simmer and season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. **Braise in Oven:** Nestle the browned chicken and any accumulated juices into the liquid and vegetables in the pan. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and cook, uncovered, until the chicken is fully cooked through and tender, and the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes.

7. **Serve:** Discard the herb sprigs and bay leaf. Serve the chicken cacciatore right away, garnishing with minced flat-leaf parsley if desired.

Enjoy your meal!
