# Bánh Mì with Roasted Pork

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into matchsticks
- 1/2 medium daikon radish, peeled and cut into matchsticks
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 pound pork tenderloin
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 (12-inch) baguette
- 1/2 medium English cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 jalapeño pepper, thinly sliced

**Instructions:**

1. **Pickle the Vegetables:** In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Place 1 medium carrot (cut into matchsticks) and 1/2 medium daikon radish (also cut into matchsticks) in a heatproof bowl or jar. Pour the warm pickling liquid over the vegetables, ensuring they are fully submerged. Let them sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce until smooth. Set aside.

3. **Marinate the Pork:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Rub this mixture evenly over 1 pound of pork tenderloin.

4. **Roast the Pork:** Place the seasoned pork tenderloin on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C), about 20 to 25 minutes. Once done, remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing thinly.

5. **Prepare the Baguette:** While the pork is resting, cut 1 (12-inch) baguette in half lengthwise, leaving it hinged on one side. If desired, warm the baguette in the oven for a few minutes until crisp.

6. **Assemble the Bánh Mì:** Spread the prepared mayonnaise mixture evenly on both cut sides of the baguette. Arrange the thinly sliced roasted pork on the bottom half. Drain the pickled vegetables and layer them over the pork. Add 1/2 medium English cucumber (thinly sliced), 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, and 1 thinly sliced jalapeño pepper, distributing them evenly. Close the sandwich by bringing the top half of the baguette over the fillings.

7. **Serve:** Cut the assembled bánh mì into individual portions, if desired, and serve immediately.
