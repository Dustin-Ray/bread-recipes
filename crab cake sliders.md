# Cajun Crab Cake Sliders

**Ingredients:**

- 5 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- 2 celery ribs, finely chopped
- 1/2 green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 large egg
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound jumbo lump crabmeat, picked through
- 1 cup crushed Saltine crackers
- Remoulade sauce, for serving
- 10 brioche slider buns, toasted
- 2 Roma tomatoes, sliced
- 10 butter lettuce leaves

**Instructions:**

1. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil; swirl to coat the pan.
   - Add 2 finely chopped celery ribs, 1/2 finely chopped green bell pepper, and 2 thinly sliced scallions. Cook, stirring frequently, until slightly softened, about 2 to 3 minutes.
   - Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves; season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
   - Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large bowl and let cool slightly.

2. **Prepare the Crab Cake Mixture:**
   - To the bowl with the cooled vegetable mixture, add 1 large egg, 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Whisk to combine.
   - Using a spatula, gently fold in 1 pound of picked-through jumbo lump crabmeat and 1 cup of crushed Saltine crackers, being careful not to break up the crabmeat too much.
   - Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, portion the crab mixture into 10 patties.

3. **Cook the Crab Cakes:**
   - Wipe the skillet clean. In the same skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil until shimmering.
   - Add 5 crab cake patties and cook, turning halfway through, until both sides are deep golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
   - Transfer the cooked patties to a plate.
   - Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons of canola oil and the remaining 5 patties.

4. **Assemble the Sliders:**
   - Spread remoulade sauce on the cut sides of each of the 10 toasted brioche slider buns.
   - Place a crab cake patty on the bottom half of each bun.
   - Top each patty with a slice of Roma tomato and a butter lettuce leaf.
   - Close the sliders with the top halves of the buns.

Enjoy your meal!
